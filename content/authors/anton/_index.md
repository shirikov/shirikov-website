I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I study media, political communication, misinformation and propaganda. In my dissertation, I use experiments and survey data to examine when biased media are found more credible and who is more sensitive to political bias in the news. In my other work, I study the legacies of communism and contemporary political institutions in the former Soviet Union.

I am fascinated by the modern tools of computational social science, including digital data collection, automated text analysis, machine learning, and network analysis.

Before graduate school, I have worked as a journalist and an editor in Russian [independent](https://republic.ru/) [media](https://www.rbc.ru/), covering politics and technology. That experience continues to inform my academic interests.
